Snapdown
========

**Draw snapshot diagrams with plain text**


Development
-----------

Open `test/development.html`, which includes dependencies from unpkg and generates a parser on the fly.

To build the production version:
 - `vagrant up` to provision a VM with Node.js
 - `npm run build` to generate `dist/snapdown.min.js`
